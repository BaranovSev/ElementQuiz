Slime is made using a chemical reaction between a polymer (like PVA glue) and a thickener (like sodium tetraborate). This creates a Non-Newtonian fluid that behaves like a solid when hit hard and like a liquid when hit gently. In this topic, we will discuss the main components and steps involved in making slime, as well as some tips and recipes."

Over time, its popularity increased, especially due to social media, where users share their recipes and showcase unique types of slime. Slimes are easy to crumple with your hands, have a sticky surface and collect pet hair very well. By the way, this is exactly what slimes were created for — collecting lint and hair from clothes. But the thing turned out to be so funny that the children turned the slimes into a toy."
